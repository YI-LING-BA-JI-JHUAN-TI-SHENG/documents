# target\_frame map does not exist

## Cause

+ When running amcl.launch (`$ roslaunch robot_navigation_pkg amcl.launch`)

## Error message

```
[ WARN] [1525189219.914934424, 19.730000000]: Timed out waiting for transform from base_footprint to map to become available before running costmap, tf error: canTransform: target_frame map does not exist.. canTransform returned after 0.105 timeout was 0.1.
```

## Solved

+ Find that it need `/joint_states` but `/robot1/joint_states`
+ Therefore delete robot group and prefix.

## Other

+ Maybe `<remap>` can fix.
